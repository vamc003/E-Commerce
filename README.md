## Introduction
This README provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a Django project with a customized admin panel and uploading the project to GitHub.
## Project Setup
1.Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.
2.Install virtualenv to create a virtual environment for your project:

pip install virtualenv

3.Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

mkdir django-admin-customization
cd django-admin-customization
## Django Installation
1.Create a virtual environment:

virtualenv venv

2.Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate
Install Django:

pip install django
## Create a Django Project
1.Create a new Django project:

django-admin startproject myproject
2.Navigate into the project directory:

cd myproject
## Create a Django App
1.Create a new Django app:

python manage.py startapp myapp
2.Add the new app to the INSTALLED_APPS list in myproject/settings.py:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'myapp',
]
## Customizing the Admin Panel
1.Open myapp/admin.py and register your models:

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import MyModel

@admin.register(MyModel)

class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):

    list_display = ('field1', 'field2', 'field3')
    
    search_fields = ('field1', 'field2')
    
2.Customize further by adding list filters, inlines, and more configurations as needed.
## Database Migration
1.Create initial migrations for your app:

python manage.py makemigrations
Apply the migrations to create the database schema:

python manage.py migrate
## Creating a Superuser
1.Create a superuser to access the admin panel:

python manage.py createsuperuser

2.Follow the prompts to create the superuser account.
## Running the Development Server
1.Run the development server:

python manage.py runserver

2.Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to access the admin panel. Use the superuser credentials to log in.
## Conclusion
You have successfully set up a Django project with a customized admin panel and uploaded it to GitHub. Follow these steps for any new projects you wish to develop and share. For further customization, refer to the Django documentation.
